# 🔍 Reflection in C#

Reflection in C# allows you to inspect metadata about assemblies, modules, and types at runtime. It's a powerful feature commonly used for:

- Inspecting types and members
- Accessing custom attributes
- Dynamically creating instances and invoking methods
- Plugin systems and dependency injection frameworks

## 🛠️ How to Run

Make sure the project is built using .NET:

```bash
cd Reflection
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

Or if this is a class library, reference it from a console app to run specific demos.

## 💡 Use Cases in Real Projects

- Logging frameworks
- Dependency injection containers
- Unit testing tools
- ORMs like Entity Framework
- Plugin-based architecture (e.g., Visual Studio extensions)
